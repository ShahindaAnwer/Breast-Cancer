# Breast-Cancer Project
Classifying whether or not a person has breast cancer

### Libraries
- [Tensorflow - Keras](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/keras)
- [tensorflow](https://www.tensorflow.org/)
- [matplotlib](http://matplotlib.org/)
- [Numpy](https://numpy.org/)
- [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/)

### Code
I uploaded 2 notebooks; `Breast_Cancer_Classification_using_Logistic_Regression.ipynb` and `Breast_Cancer_Classification_using_NN.ipynb`
In the first notebook, I implemented a Logistic Regression Classsifier to predict if the woman has breast cancer, and in the second one I did the same thing but with neural networks instead.

### Data
Breast Cancer Datasets
